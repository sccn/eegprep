## how to duplicate a function

1. Get a python file fully functional loading the same file as MATLAB - DO NOT CREATE A FUNCTION AND ADD CODE TO LOAD (and maybe plot results)

2. Get a MATLAB file to load the same file

3. Start the debugger in both and compare. Note that it is better to use the debugger on Python file than Jupyter Notebook (could not get it to stop)

4. Once the result is the same, package the python code in a function the same name as MATLAB

5. Write the function to compare (see example) and the helper Python function to load the file (note that there could be a general python helper function)
